        "- PANAS refers to the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, a widely used psychological scale that measures an individual's mood by assessing both positive and negative emotions. Developed in 1988 by Watson, Clark, and Tellegen, it's a 20-item self-report measure used in research and clinical settings to gauge how frequently someone experiences emotions like interest, joy, enthusiasm (positive affect) versus feelings of distress, sadness, and nervousness (negative affect).\n",
        "## How it works\n",
        "- 20 items: The scale consists of 20 words that describe different feelings and emotions.\n",
        "- Two dimensions: These items are separated into two subscales: one for positive affect (PA) and one for negative affect (NA).\n",
        "- Rating scale: Participants rate how they felt about each item over a specific time frame (e.g., \"right now,\" \"today,\" \"over the past few weeks\") on a 5-point scale.\n",
        "- Scoring: Each positive and negative item is scored individually. The total positive score and total negative score are then calculated. A higher positive score indicates more positive affect, while a higher negative score indicates more negative affect."
